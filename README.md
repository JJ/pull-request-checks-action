# Get checklist from the body of a PR


## Validate (from original)

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:
