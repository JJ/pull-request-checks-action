# Contribution guide

This is written in TypeScript. Feel free to contribute. I would prefer if you
work on an existing issue, or use an issue to justify your contribution; if it's
a bug fix, just go ahead.

If the main business logic, contained in [`src/checks.ts`](src/checks.ts) is
modified, stick around for a while until existing tests pass, or create new
tests for any new logic that you will be adding.
